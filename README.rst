======================================
Leabra Tensorflow - Under Construction
======================================

A tensorflow + TPU exploration of the "Local, Error-driven and Associative,
Biologically Realistic Algorithm" (LEABRA). For details see the
`wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leabra>`_ or
`emergent <https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Leabra>`_ pages.

Implementation is drawn from this paper by Randall C. O'Reilly: 
`Generalization in Interactive Networks: The Benefits of Inhibitory Competition and Hebbian Learning <https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/08997660152002834>`_.
